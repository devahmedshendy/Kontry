This app communicates with http://restcountries.eu/ API which provide details about countries like name, flag, currencies, capital, population and much more, and implements the following features.

## NOTES
> This app is made for learning purpose only.  

> I didn't give any attention to landscape mode while development, it is not disabled thought, and ContraintLayout was only used to advance my development skills using it.  

> This is an early stage for the application and only tested once or couple times, and as long as it is for learning purpose, I don't solve any bugs and - Inshaa Allah - I will go better in next new apps. But things work fine as showed in below demos.  

## âš  WARNING
- Regarding Internet Connection Availability  
  I only practiced how to use the android way to handle this, so you can turn off WIFI/Data and app will react for it, once you turn it back on app will return working properly again.  
  Which means, if WIFI is ON and actually no internet, app will react buggy. This is easy to be handled but I kept it later for other app.
  
- VPN is ON but WIFI/Data is OFF  
  I still didn't learn well why this happens, but VPN case is different, I found on some phone that VPN settings fools the android framework that connectivity is available even WIFI/Data is OFF .. still need time to learn why is that happening and WILL APPLY IT LATER IN ANOTHER APP.
